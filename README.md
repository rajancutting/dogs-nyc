## How many dogs are in NYC? 

NYC requires that all dogs are up-to-date with vaccinations and that their owners register them with the Health Department. These licenses are only valid for
1 to 5 years depending on which type the owner purchases. According to the data which reported dog licenses issued from 2014-2018, there were 110,658 dogs with
active licenses at the end of 2018. But these numbers are almost certaintly inaccurate and grossly underestimate the true number of dogs in NYC. 

<h3> Compliance with the system </h3>

When a puppy is under four months old, owners are only permitted to purchase a one year license. Afterwards they can purchase a license valid for 1 to 5
years. However the price for each license varies, and the 1 year option is the cheapest. The following histogram shows that more 
than 76% of the licenses issued since 2014 were valid for 1 year.

 That means that the owners have to renew the licenes each year for their dogs to have accurate records. Comparing the number of licenses that expired 
 from 2016-2018 with the number of licenses issued shows that licenes are not being renwed.

 In 2018 there were more than 30 thousand licenses that expired than there were licenses that were issued. Within the data there is no distinction between license 
 renewals or new licenses for dogs that were recently purchased/adopted. In seeing the trend from 2016, it is reasonable to assume that overall less dogs were
 being purhcased in 2018 compared to 2016. But other than a lack of compliance, dog death is the only way to explain a net decrease in registerations. This
 seems highly unlikely, because in 2018 the median aged dog was only 4. The following histogram also shows that majority of dogs in the city are fairly young.

 Therefore it can clearly be stated that dog owners in new york are not complying with keeping their registrations up-to-date. 
 
<h3>Relevance</h3>

Understanding how many dogs are in NYC is important information for the city to have. The Parks Department might use that information to decide which zip
codes to build dog parks in, or which parks should have longer off-leash hours. The Sanitation Department could use this information to implement collection
programs in certain neighborhoods to divert dog waste from landfills. <a href="https://github.com/rajancutting/city-waste-collection"> This other project </a>
tracks the Sanitation Department's progress on the city's goal of diverting 90% of waste from landfills by 2030. Implementing a separate pet waste collection
could be helpful to that end.

There are many reasons why the city should be interested in having reliable information about the dog population. The city government should change the 
structure to incentivize owners to purchase licenses with longer expiration times. That is one of the simplest things they can do.

## Future Work

Need to look more into adoption data to understand how many new dogs are purchased each year. It is probably reasonable to suspect that shelters and breeders
maintain more accurate up-to-date data.
